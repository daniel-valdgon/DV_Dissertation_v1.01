\maketitle   

\begin{abstract}

Economists have the opportunity and the responsibility of helping to design public policies. In the policy design, we need to have clear both the big picture and the details. The details convert a good policy in paper to a successful implemented policy in practice. 

This dissertation is all about the details! It shows how the economic efficiency of fiscal policy, measured by the size of the fiscal multiplier, is affected by three overlooked \enquote{details}, namely: political favoritism, elite capture and composition of government purchases. 

In the first chapter, \enquote{\textit{The Unintended Consequences of Political Alignment: Evidence from Mexico}}, I study the economic effects of politically motivated spending. I use a close-election research design that exploits variation in political alignment, between governors and mayors, during a period when political alignment implied a substantial increase in intergovernmental transfers. I find that political alignment increases intergovernmental transfers and public spending while slowing down private-sector employment. I find suggestive evidence that this slowdown is explained by the opportunity cost of reallocating economic activity toward rent-seeking activities. 

In the second chapter, \enquote{\textit{Distributional Effects of Intergovernmental Transfers in Mexico}}---co-authored with Carlos, Kiyomi, and Laura---,
we estimate the welfare effects of placed-based policies (PBP) that are targeted at lagging economic areas. We study the case of the Fund of Social Infrastructure (FAIS) in Mexico, one of the largest PBP in the world that provides infrastructure-earmarks to lagging economic areas. We use a simulated instrument research design and find that an increase of FAIS translates into an increase in the coverage of social infrastructure (e.g. electricity, sewerage, piped water). However, the benefits in terms of infrastructure are not followed by higher household income or lower monetary poverty. The missing effect of FAIS on welfare is explained by the bulk of the economic gains being captured by the non-poor residents of the initially targeted poor places.

In the third chapter, \enquote{\textit{Heterogeneous Spending, Heterogeneous Multipliers}}---co-authored with Pedro and Umberto---, we ask whether the size of the local employment and earnings multipliers depends on the composition of the government purchases. We answer this question by building a panel of military spending at the product-MSA-year level. We use this dataset in a shift-share research design to exploit the heterogeneous sensitivity of local military spending to national military buildups and drawdowns. We find that the goods and services that the government purchases determine the size of the local fiscal multiplier. Local fiscal multipliers are larger when public spending focuses its demand on labor-intensive industries.

\chapter*{Dedication}
Our achievements are not our own. From womb to tomb, we are in debt to others. I dedicate this work to several people.

First, I dedicate this to Sanchi, also known as Diana. She did not need to read a single line of this work to give me the love, courage, and spirit I needed to continue pushing through it. Also, this has to be dedicated to Marcelo and/or Danielle.

Second, I dedicate this to my family. Pa (Jaime), Ma (Estella), Pipe and Kta Gracias! Every effort, sacrifice, and mistake you made brought me here, so the degree is only yours. 

Third, only a few hundred out of millions of people with the same opportunities I had obtained a Ph.D. Some would say it was because of my effort, madness, or good luck. I would say it was a good God. I dedicate it to you God.

\chapter*{Acknowledgments}

First, I want to thank my advisors. I am indebted to Laurent. A mentor of few words but who gave me uncountable lessons. Thanks for showing me the humanity behind being a researcher, never stopping believing in me, and always being there. There is no perfect advisor, but he was close to being perfect. I want to also thank Martin for his advice in the moments when I needed them most and for sharing with me the \textit{treasure} of his knowledge of poverty and inequality. I want to also thank Carlos for his unconditional support and mentoring before, during, and after the Ph.D.

I want to also thank my committee members. Thanks to Garance for her genuine interest and efforts in my job market. I would have loved to have her as co-advisor from the beginning. Also, I thank Toshi for adopting me into his reading group, for his integrity as a person, his wisdom in the art of research, and his sense of duty. 

Thanks to the family that Georgetown gave me, I would never make it without them. They were there for me for the comps, the proposal, the parties, the thanksgiving, and the unexpected rollercoaster of the job market. Thanks to  Pedro, Rodi, Carolina, Mari, Umberto, Juan, Arturo, JJ, Kevin, Linis, Jacq, Minji, Deno, Bingxi, Sub, Gaurav, Mariel, Madhu, Allison.

Thanks to friends and mentors who were spread all over the world. All the conversations with you reminded me of why I got into graduate school and gave me the energy to believe that I could do it. Thank you Raul Andres, Andres, Jose Daniel, Thiago, German, Checho, Dario, July, Adri, Paul, Jorge, Hector, Del, Maria Isabel, Monik, Ricardo, Joana, Niko and Juana. 

I would love to thank my family. Gracias a Pa (Jaime), Ma (Estella), Pipe and Kta. I am just the consequence of their love, mistakes, and sacrifice. Impossible to tell my story without telling theirs. The saying goes, "...you do not choose your family" well, I would not have chosen a better one. Thanks for waiting for me, for taking care of yourselves when it was my responsibility. 

Finally, again and again, I thank God. 

%Many classmates and faculty at Georgetown provided invaluable feedback and%support. Thank you especially to Pedro, Umberto, Carlos,  all my co-authors, Pedro, Umberto, Pedro and UmbertoDario Sansone and Mike Packard. I would also like to acknowledge Nicola Persico, Philip Marx, Gaurav Bagwe, and Juan Margitic for useful feedback on previous drafts of these chapters
